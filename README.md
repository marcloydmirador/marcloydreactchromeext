# Developer Assessment for Marcloyd Mirador


# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Development

* Run script
```bash
# build files to './dev'
# start webpack development server
$ npm run dev

* If you're developing Inject page, please allow `https://localhost:3000` connections. (Because `injectpage` injected GitHub (https) pages, so webpack server procotol must be https.)
* [Load unpacked extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) with `./dev` folder.
